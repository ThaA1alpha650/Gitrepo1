            <p>Hello my name is Luc Foglizzo I am a student at UC Berkeley Extension I absolutely love computers and attending a class like this has been my dream for quite a while. The pace of the class is super fast and i got sick the first week which
                i believe is probably related to stress. I stress out easily and so im trying my hardest to catch up and at the same time still understand everything I am doing and writing. I already knew a bit of HTML but new to CSS and everything else.
                I believe in myself!<a href="https://github.com/ThaA1alpha650">My github</a></p>
